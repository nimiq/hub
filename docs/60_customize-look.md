## Customize Overlay

During a Hub pop-up being open, an overlay (backdrop) will be shown over your site. This helps users to find the pop-up window in case they changed windows, e.g. by accident. Clicking the overlay will focus the pop-up again. The overlay will disappear when the user returns from the Hub back to your site.

You can adapt the looks. And if you need for some reason, also hide it (not recommended). To adjust the background color, use the overlay's ID `#nimiq-hub-overlay` in your CSS and `!important` on the new `background` setting to override the inline CSS.
